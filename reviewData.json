All rooms are huge and nicely furnished to keep you occupied and enjoying gathering the family in one spot. We enjoyed croquet on the lawn, riding bikes on nearby Shining Sea Bike Path, pizza at nearby restaurant and market, and wonderful bread and bakery items from nearby market. Beaches are very close by. Very nice location and wonderfully accessorized home for family get together",

        "reviewText": "Our stay at the Old Stone Barn was fantastic! We loved it! It was conveniently located to many places of interest. The weather was perfect, with the exception of one rainy day when we went to Boston. Our grandson who lives in Bourne, felt that we had made a wonderful choice in selecting accommodations. So did our little three year old granddaughter who really didn't want to leave. The place was so roomy and homey, and we especially loved the sun room. Books and games were plentiful for all ages. The kitchen was equipped with everything a cook would want/need, including spices and a large variety of cookware. The uniqueness of the house was just perfect for our family, and we would love to return sometime for a family reunion. Our only regret was that we didn't have a longer vacation. We truly got a lovely taste of Cape Cod. Thank you for the recommendations of places to see and enjoy in the area. The key lime pie at 'Pie in the Sky' was outstanding! Thank you for 'hosting' our family. The history of the Old Stone Barn should be included with every contract. Most interesting.",

Old Silver Beach is nearby and the town of Falmouth has delightful shops, cafes, and that quaint New England atmosphere the Cape is known for. Ask the owner for a history of the Old Stone Barn--fascinating!",

The home is also well appointed and conveniently located with easy access to the bike path, the beaches of West Falmouth, the town of Falmouth, and down to Woods Hole.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to spend time in a beautiful part of Cape Cod.",

We would rent the Old Stone Barn again and again. The owners are nice people who answered all our questions prior to the rental. Parking for 5 cars easily. Lots of games and books for kids and adults.<br/>4 bathrooms were a real plus. Great location away from from traffic but close to shopping and entertainment. Great backkyard for kids an adults. The master bedroom views are to die for. We could go on and on. In short, it is a great house for a short or long term rental. Should we return to the Cape this property would be our first choice.",
